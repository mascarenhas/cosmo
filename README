Cosmo is a "safe templates" engine.  It allows you to fill nested
templates, providing many of the advantages of Turing-complete
template engines, without without the downside of allowing arbitrary
code in the templates.

The current version of Cosmo is 16.06.04. This release adds support
for Lua 5.3.

The previous version, 14.03.04, fixed a bug uncovered by a new version of LPEG.
Version 13.01.30 added support for Lua 5.2. Version 10.04.06 added
expressions to selectors $(\<exp\>),
allowed nested \[\[ \]\] in templates, made commas between subtemplates
optional, and added a second parameter to cosmo.yield that tells Cosmo
the first parameter is a literal to be included in the expansion instead
of an environment.

Cosmo is installed as a rock. To install the most recent release
do `luarocks install cosmo`. The Cosmo rock is in the standard
repository. Installation on UNIX-based systems need the gcc toolchain.
